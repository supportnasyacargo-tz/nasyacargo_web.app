-- Staff profile pictures.
--
-- Adds one nullable column to the existing staff_profiles table (the path
-- of the currently-active photo, not a URL — the bucket is private, so a
-- signed URL is minted on demand by the frontend and never persisted) and
-- a new private Storage bucket with its own RLS policies.
--
-- Ownership boundary is enforced by Storage RLS itself, not just by what
-- buttons the UI shows: a staff member may only write to their own
-- "{user_id}/profile.{ext}" object; an Admin may write to any staff
-- member's — mirroring the exact "self OR Admin" shape already used by
-- staff_profiles' own "staff can update own profile" /
-- "admins can update any profile" policies (see 0001_shipments_and_auth.sql).
-- MIME type and file size are enforced at the bucket level (native Storage
-- feature), so a client-side check is only ever a fast-fail convenience,
-- never the real gate.

-- Bucket: private (public = false). Every read/write already requires an
-- authenticated Supabase session in this app (see 0001's RLS comment on why
-- the anon/publishable key has no table access at all) — a public bucket
-- would be the first exception to that, so this stays private and reads go
-- through short-lived signed URLs instead.
