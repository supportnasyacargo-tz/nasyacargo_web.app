-- Controlled Data Deletion / Archive System.
--
-- Audit findings (by inspecting every table's RLS policy and every FK's ON
-- DELETE behavior, not just the frontend delete buttons):
--
--   customers        -- "for all ... using (true)" let ANY authenticated
--                        staff hard-delete ANY customer via a direct table
--                        call; only the Customers.tsx UI checked for
--                        existing shipments, and only client-side.
--   shipments        -- same blanket policy. Worse: payment_records.
--                        shipment_id is "on delete cascade", so deleting a
--                        shipment with POSTED payments would silently wipe
--                        the payment_records evidence for money already
--                        booked in the (immutable) journal_entries ledger —
--                        a real reconciliation hazard. (Packed/delivered
--                        shipments already have a safety net via existing
--                        "on delete restrict" FKs from shipment_items and
--                        shipment_delivery_confirmations — this migration
--                        closes the payments/invoice gap specifically.)
--   packing_lists    -- same blanket policy, and no guard at all against
--                        deleting a Closed/Dispatched list (only Draft was
--                        ever *meant* to be deletable — guard_packing_list_
--                        lock() only fires on UPDATE, never DELETE).
--   payment_records,
--   expenses,
--   journal_entries,
--   journal_lines,
--   other_income     -- already correctly guarded by the existing
--                        accounting migration (20260815013917): posted rows
--                        are immutable (guard_posted_accounting_document /
--                        guard_posted_journal_lines), and journal_entries /
--                        journal_lines / other_income have no direct
--                        INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE grant for `authenticated` at
--                        all — every write goes through a SECURITY DEFINER
--                        RPC. No changes needed here; this migration does
--                        not touch these tables.
--   staff_profiles   -- already correctly refuses hard delete: deleteUser()
--                        in useAuthStore.ts always throws and tells the
--                        caller to disable the account instead. No DB
--                        change needed; confirmed by reading, not assumed.
--   company_settings -- had an "admin manager can delete settings" DELETE
--                        policy with no UI path to it and no legitimate use
--                        case (the app assumes exactly one settings row
--                        exists everywhere it reads company_settings) —
--                        removed entirely below. Never-hard-delete, no
--                        exceptions, not even for Admin.
--
-- Classification applied below:
--   customers   -> safe-delete only with zero shipments; controlled-archive
--                  (archived_at/by, RPC-guarded) otherwise.
--   shipments   -> safe-delete only with no invoice, no journal entry, no
--                  payments (the already-existing FK restricts already
--                  cover packed/delivered); controlled-void (voided_at/by/
--                  reason, RPC-guarded, status untouched) otherwise.
--   packing_lists -> safe-delete only while Draft (matches the existing,
--                  already-Draft-only frontend flow — now enforced
--                  server-side too); never-hard-delete once Closed or
--                  Dispatched.
--   payment_records / expenses / journal* / other_income -> already
--                  never-hard-delete once posted (pre-existing).
--   staff_profiles -> already never-hard-delete (pre-existing).
--   company_settings -> never-hard-delete (hardened below).
--
-- Every guard below reuses public.business_audit_log for the archive/void/
-- delete trail — no new audit table, per the spec's explicit instruction.
