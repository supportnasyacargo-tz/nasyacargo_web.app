-- Real Shipment Delete + Payment Refund.
--
-- Void, Refund and Delete are three different concepts and this migration
-- keeps them that way rather than collapsing them:
--   VOID     = a financial/document transaction invalidated but RETAINED for
--              audit (existing void_shipment()/void_accounting_entry() —
--              unchanged by this migration).
--   REFUNDED = money that was actually received has been paid back to the
--              customer. The original payment stays in history forever with
--              status REFUNDED, linked to a new payment_refunds row and a
--              reversal journal entry — never deleted, never relabeled VOID.
--   DELETED  = the shipment record itself is permanently removed. Until
--              now this was impossible for any shipment with a payment on
--              file (guard_and_log_shipment_delete() blocked it outright,
--              "void it instead"). That blanket rule stays for shipments
--              with real warehouse activity (packing history, returns, a
--              delivery confirmation) — those still require void. For a
--              shipment that never got that far, delete is now allowed, and
--              any payment history on it is DETACHED (shipment_id -> null,
--              with a snapshot of what shipment it was for) rather than
--              cascade-deleted, so "Delete Shipment & Keep Financial Record"
--              is literal: the shipment disappears, the money trail doesn't.
--
-- refund_payment() is modeled directly on the existing void_accounting_entry()
-- primitive (same mirror-image reversal-entry mechanics) — it is not a new
-- accounting engine, just a thin wrapper that also records refund-specific
-- detail (method, date, who processed it, reason) that void alone doesn't
-- capture, and relabels the payment REFUNDED instead of VOIDED afterward.
