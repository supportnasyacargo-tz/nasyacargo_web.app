-- Invoice repair, invoice amendment, customer discounts and idempotent expense
-- recording.
--
-- Four gaps are closed here:
--   1. A shipment whose invoice is finalized but whose invoice journal is
--      missing (for example because the journal was removed during a data
--      cleanup) could never accept a payment and had no repair path.
--   2. A finalized invoice that was entered incorrectly could not be corrected
--      at all: the pricing snapshot is immutable by design and nothing was
--      allowed to void and reissue it.
--   3. shipments.discount existed but was never written, never posted to the
--      ledger and never shown.
--   4. Expenses had no idempotency key, so a double submit created duplicate
--      expenses and duplicate journal entries.
--
-- Semantics chosen for discounts (important):
--   shipments.invoice_amount stays the NET amount the customer owes, so every
--   existing Total Due formula keeps working untouched. The gross invoice value
--   is derived as invoice_amount + discount. The ledger records the gross as
--   revenue and the discount as contra-revenue, so a discount is visible in the
--   income statement instead of silently shrinking revenue.

--     through, and direct inserts bypass the RPC entirely.
